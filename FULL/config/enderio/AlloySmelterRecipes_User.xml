<!-- 
Custom recipes that will not be over written by Ender IO are added here.
Examples of recipes can be found in AlloySmelterRecipes_Core.xml and general format
documentation in SAGMillRecipes_Core/User.

As well as adding custom recipes the operation of the Alloy Smelter as a vanilla furnace 
can be controlled. It can be disabled completely by simply adding this line:

  <vanillaFurnaceRecipes enabled="false"/>    

It is also possible to selectively disable vanilla furnace recipes.
The following example disables the smelting of iron ingots, ender pearls and any form of iron ore registered in the
ore dictionary.

  <vanillaFurnaceRecipes>    
    <exclude>
      <itemStack itemID="265" /> 
      <itemStack itemID="368" /> 
      <itemStack oreDictionary="oreIron" />  
    </exclude>

  </vanillaFurnaceRecipes>
  
  Add this line to disbale the creation of TE alloys using the Alloy Smelter.
  <recipeGroup name="Thermal Expansion" enabled="false"/>
