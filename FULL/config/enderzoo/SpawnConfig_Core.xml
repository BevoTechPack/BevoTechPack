Specifies the spawning behavior of Ender Zoo mobs. 
These settings can be modified, and changes can be made to non Ender Zoo mobs in the SpawnConfig_User.xml file.
This file will be replaced each time Ender Zoo is loaded and is only placed in the config dir as a guide to creating
entries in the user file.

Note that all entries are applied in order. This allows, for example, for existing slime spawns in swamps to be removed in one
entry, and then in the following (using a different ID) they can be added back with different rates / group sizes. 

entry attributes:
- entry.id:
  Used to uniquely identify the entry. If an entry with this id exists in the user file that entry will replace the one in
  the core file.
  
- entry.mobName: The name used to register the mob with Minecraft. 

- entry.creatureType: (Optional, default monster) The type of mob. Values must match the names in EnumCreatureType. Valid entries:
                     monster, creature, ambient, waterCreature

- entry.rate: The rate at which the entities are spawned, for example 10=Enderman spawn rate, 100=Zombie spawn rate

- entry.minGroupSize: (Optional, default 1) the minimum number of mobs to be spawned per group 

- entry.maxGroupSize: (Optional, default 3) the maximum number of mobs to be spawned per group

- entry.remove: (Optional, default false) if true all all existing spawn entries matching this entry will be removed rather than added
                in this case the rate is ignored, but must still be included cause I am lazy

Each entry can include 0 or more biomes. To remove an entry from the core file via the user file create an entry with the
same id and 0 biomeTypes.

 
 
 biomeType attributes:
 - name: The name of the biome type. There can be many biomes registered for a specific type based on the mods installed
         Any number of biome types can be listed for an entry 
         All valid biome types that are listed in BiomeDictionary.Type. The base types are:
         MESA, FOREST, PLAINS, MOUNTAIN, HILLS, SWAMP, SANDY, SNOWY, WASTELAND, BEACH, MUSHROOM, OCEAN, RIVER, NETHER, END 
          
         The special name BASE_LAND_TYPES includes:
         MESA, FOREST, PLAINS, MOUNTAIN, HILLS, SWAMP, SANDY, SNOWY, WASTELAND, BEACH
