Work notes for BTP 15

Requires Forge 10.13.4.1566 minimum

Major update of all mods
This release will not be compatible from older versions of BTP, perhaps a new name is needed.
Some mods no longer supported but still appear to function, testing needed to ensure they don't break anything.

After testing existing 1 for 1 upgrade between old and updated pack, need to decide on new additions.

Immersive Engineering added.
Bevo loves space, so more planets added.
Replacement for SFM since it has always been broken, looks like there's an updated version forked by another modder (question over permissions)

Ideas over HQM quests - 6 chapters done.
Ideas on mod progression - Done, base TE/EIO/MFR/Bot changed to steel, need to add new steel recipes.

Question over pack optionals

Need test jockies
Tested various planet dimensions as I've problems with a lot of crashing, now hopefully resolved.

Need Bevo's picture
