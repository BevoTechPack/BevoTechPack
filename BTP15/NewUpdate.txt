Work notes for BTP 15

Major update of all mods
Very likely to break old worlds and the mod version jump is huge for the vast majority of mods.
Some mods no longer supported but still appear to function, testing needed to ensure they don't break anything.

After testing existing 1 for 1 upgrade between old and updated pack, need to decide on new additions.

Immersive Engineering added.
Bevo loves space, so more planets added.
Replacement for SFM since it has always been broken, looks like there's an updated version forked by another modder (question over permissions)

Ideas over HQM quests - 4 chapters done
Ideas on mod progression - tweaks made, more to do

Quest over pack optionals

Need test jockies
