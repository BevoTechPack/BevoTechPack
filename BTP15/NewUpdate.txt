Work notes for BTP 15

Requires Forge 10.13.4.1566 minimum

Major update of all mods
This release will not be compatible from older versions of BTP, perhaps a new name is needed.
Some mods no longer supported but still appear to function, testing needed to ensure they don't break anything.

Java V8 Required

Updated - Everything


Added 7 chapters into HQM (space based and given it a storyline - Bevo is Lost in Space), added a 7th chapter which is a complete tutorial for Magneticraft. I would like to do the same with Nuclearcraft unfortunately I don't know the mod well enough.

Tiered mods through harder recipes and steel.

CURRENT STATE OF PACK - MOD list complete, recipes complete, currently play testing through HQM.
